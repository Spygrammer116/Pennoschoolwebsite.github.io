        <h2 class="academics_heading">Stage 4: Year 7 and 8</h2>
        <p class="parafour">The curriculum in Years 7 and 8 gives students experience in a wide range of subjects and is designed to develop and broaden students’ skills and interests in learning. In Year 7 all students study a core curriculum:</p>
        <p class="parafour">
            English <br> Geography <br>History <br>Languages – French, Japanese, Mandarin(2 languages are studied over 4 terms in Year 7, with one of 3 chosen to continue in Year 8) <br>Mathematics <br>Music <br>Physical Education (PE) and Health <br>Science <br>Technology <br>Visual Arts
        </p>
        <p class="parafour">
            Year 8 students pursue a similar core curriculum, but also have enrichment courses running for one term each. They are:
        </p>
        <p class="parafour">
            Agriculture <br> Drama/Music <br> Information Technology/Multimedia <br> Visual Arts
        </p>
        <h2 class="headings">Sport</h2>
        <p class="parafour">
            In Year 7, sport is integrated into the school timetable. This means that you will play sport according to timetabled lessons rather than on a set afternoon. Sport is taught by the PDHPE staff. <br><br>All students are expected to participate in sport, wearing full sports uniform. If you are unable to participate in sport, you must bring a note from home explaining the circumstances. Students wear full school uniform every day, so you must bring your sport uniform to change into for sport or PE lessons.
        </p>
        <p class="parafour">
            From Year 8, students play sport on Thursday afternoon. Both grade and social sports are offered. A separate School Bytes Online Sport Selection Student Instruction form will be included in your enrolment pack. <br><br>Stage 4 students participate in a Gala Day, when they have the opportunity to compete against other schools in various sports such as Basketball, Netball, Soccer, Speedaway,  European Handball, OzTag, AFL and many more. <br><br>Pennant Hills High School has a proud tradition of success in swimming, cross-country running and athletics. You will have the opportunity to participate in all these sports and to be selected to represent the school at higher levels.
        </p>
        <h2 class="headings">Special Religious Education (SRE)</h2>
        <p class="parafour">
            Special Religious Education is available in Stage 4 and 5 through an approved provider to those students whose parents/caregivers choose to have them receive such instruction.
        </p>
        <h2 class="headings">Homework</h2>
        <p class="parafour">
            To successfully cope with the pressure of high school work, it is strongly advised that a regular effort be made to review and prepare work. High school is very different to primary school. You will study twelve separate subjects, so you will need to plan your work carefully. In Term 1, you will participate in a program called Introduction to High School Learning, which will equip you to manage your workload, among other benefits. In Year 7, students should spend about one hour each evening completing homework and assignments. This will increase as examination times approach. You will be given a homework diary to help you manage your work, and you are expected to use it each day. Teachers may also use the diary to communicate with your parents/caregivers. Parents and caregivers can assist by checking that the diary is being used efficiently.
